# For my zoho level 1 test I built this Ball Brick program using java

I picked java because of ease of defining and using functions
I used VS Code to write and debug but any other code editor should work fine as well

Running Instructions:

-Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the java program (Ball.java). Assume it's C:\.
-Type 'javac Ball.java' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption: The path variable is set).
-Now, type ' java ball ' to run your program.
-You will be able to see the result printed on the window.

The BrickBall code currently does not include the function using the special brick 'B' for extending the base of the ball platform.
